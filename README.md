===========

Emacs
-------
* python mode
* at least version 24 so can use package manager
* use your palm for meta/c keys
* projectile is cool but maybe expendable
* jedi is awesome
* brew install ctags-exuberant
* recentf (from http://emacsredux.com/blog/2013/04/05/recently-visited-files/)
* cask
* flycheck
  * `pip install pylint`, `pip install flake8`
  * use `M-x flycheck-verify-setup` to check it's set up correctly
